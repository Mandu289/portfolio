        <p>
          I'm not just an IT student — I'm also a basketball player. The court has taught me more than just how to win games; it's where I’ve learned discipline, focus, resilience, and the value of working as a team. These same qualities guide the way I code, design, and solve problems. Whether I'm building a website or debugging a program, I bring the same energy and determination I bring to every game.

          Before I became a software engineer, I was — and still am — a basketball player. Years of training and competition have shaped who I am: disciplined, focused, resilient, and always ready to work as part of a team.

Basketball taught me how to stay calm under pressure, how to keep improving, and how to push through challenges — values I carry into everything I do, on and off the court. Being an athlete isn’t just a part of my life — it’s a mindset I apply to learning, building, and growing every day.
